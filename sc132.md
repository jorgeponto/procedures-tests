# SC 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence - Level A

When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.

## Sufficient Techniques

- [G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence](g57.md) **forms**
- Marking sequences in the content as meaningful AND [G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence](g57.md)
  - [H34: Using a Unicode right-to-left mark (RLM) or left-to-right mark (LRM) to mix text direction inline](h34.md) **forms**
  - [H56: Using the dir attribute on an inline element to resolve problems with nested directional runs](h56.md) **forms**
  - [C6: Positioning content based on structural markup](c6.md) **forms**
  - [C8: Using CSS letter-spacing to control spacing within a word](c8.md) **forms**
  - [C27: Making the DOM order match the visual order](c27.md) **forms**
- FLASH15: Using the tabIndex property to specify a logical reading order and a logical tab order in Flash
- PDF3: Ensuring correct tab and reading order in PDF documents
- SL34: Using the Silverlight Default Tab Sequence and Altering Tab Sequences With Properties

Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion.

## Failures for Success Criterion 1.3.2

- [F34: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to format tables in plain text content](f34.md) **forms**
- [F33: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to create multiple columns in plain text content](f33.md) **forms**
- [F32: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to control spacing within a word](f32.md) **forms**
- [F49: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to using an HTML layout table that does not make sense when linearized](f49.md) **Tables** **forms**
- [F1: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to changing the meaning of content by positioning information with CSS](f1.md) **forms**

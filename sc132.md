# SC 1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence - Level A

When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.

## Sufficient Techniques

- G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence
  - Marking sequences in the content as meaningful AND G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence
  - H34: Using a Unicode right-to-left mark (RLM) or left-to-right mark (LRM) to mix text direction inline
  - H56: Using the dir attribute on an inline element to resolve problems with nested directional runs
  - C6: Positioning content based on structural markup
  - C8: Using CSS letter-spacing to control spacing within a word
- C27: Making the DOM order match the visual order
- FLASH15: Using the tabIndex property to specify a logical reading order and a logical tab order in Flash
- PDF3: Ensuring correct tab and reading order in PDF documents
- SL34: Using the Silverlight Default Tab Sequence and Altering Tab Sequences With Properties


## Failures for Success Criterion 1.3.2

- F34: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to format tables in plain text content
- F33: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to create multiple columns in plain text content
- F32: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to control spacing within a word
- [F49: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to using an HTML layout table that does not make sense when linearized](f49.md) **Tables**
- F1: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to changing the meaning of content by positioning information with CSS

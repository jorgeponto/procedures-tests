# Tests for F91: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 for not correctly marking up table headers

## Procedure

For all data tables, check if table headers can be correctly programmatically determined by use of one of the following mechanisms:

1. headers marked up with table header (th) elements
2. scope attributes on th for tables with more than a single row or column of table headers.
3. scope attributes on th for tables with more than a single row or column of table headers.
4. headers and data cells associated using headers and id attributes
5. headers marked up as td elements with the scope attribute
6. headers marked up with ARIA role attributes rowheader or columnheader

## Expected Results

- If all checks are false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails the Success Criterion.

## Sufficient Techniques and Failures

### Techniques

Situation A: The technology provides semantic structure to make information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable:

- ARIA11: Using ARIA landmarks to identify regions of a page
- ARIA12: Using role=heading to identify headings
- ARIA13: Using aria-labelledby to name regions and landmarks
- ARIA16: Using aria-labelledby to provide a name for user interface controls
- ARIA17: Using grouping roles to identify related form controls
- ARIA20: Using the region role to identify a region of the page
- G115: Using semantic elements to mark up structure AND H49: Using semantic markup to mark emphasized or special text
- G117: Using text to convey information that is conveyed by variations in presentation of text
- G140: Separating information and structure from presentation to enable different presentations
- ARIA24: Semantically identifying a font icon with role="img"
- Making information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable using the following techniques:
  - G138: Using semantic markup whenever color cues are used
  - H51: Using table markup to present tabular information
  - PDF6: Using table elements for table markup in PDF Documents
  - PDF20: Using Adobe Acrobat Pro's Table Editor to repair mistagged tables
  - H39: Using caption elements to associate data table captions with data tables
  - FLASH31: Specifying caption text for a DataGrid
  - H73: Using the summary attribute of the table element to give an overview of data tables
  - FLASH23: Adding summary information to a DataGrid
  - H63: Using the scope attribute to associate header cells and data cells in data tables
  - H43: Using id and headers attributes to associate data cells with header cells in data tables
  - FLASH21: Using the DataGrid component to associate column headers with cells
  - H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls
  - H65: Using the title attribute to identify form controls when the label element cannot be used
  - PDF10: Providing labels for interactive form controls in PDF documents
  - PDF12: Providing name, role, value information for form fields in PDF documents
  - FLASH32: Using auto labeling to associate text labels with form controls
  - FLASH29: Setting the label property for form components
  - FLASH25: Labeling a form control by setting its accessible name
  - H71: Providing a description for groups of form controls using fieldset and legend elements
  - SL20: Relying on Silverlight AutomationPeer Behavior to Set AutomationProperties.Name
  - SL26: Using LabeledBy to Associate Labels and Targets in Silverlight
  - H85: Using OPTGROUP to group OPTION elements inside a SELECT
  - H48: Using ol, ul and dl for lists or groups of links
  - H42: Using h1-h6 to identify headings
  - PDF9: Providing headings by marking content with heading tags in PDF documents
  - SCR21: Using functions of the Document Object Model (DOM) to add content to a page
  - PDF11: Providing links and link text using the Link annotation and the /Link structure element in PDF documents
  - PDF17: Specifying consistent page numbering for PDF documents
  - PDF21: Using List tags for lists in PDF documents
  - H97: Grouping related links using the nav element

Situation B: The technology in use does NOT provide the semantic structure to make the information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable:

- G117: Using text to convey information that is conveyed by variations in presentation of text
- FLASH8: Adding a group name to the accessible name of a form control
- Making information and relationships conveyed through presentation programmatically determinable or available in text using the following techniques:
  - T1: Using standard text formatting conventions for paragraphs
  - T2: Using standard text formatting conventions for lists
  - T3: Using standard text formatting conventions for headings

Note: Other techniques may also be sufficient if they meet the success criterion.

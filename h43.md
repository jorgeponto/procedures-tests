# Tests for H43: Using id and headers attributes to associate data cells with header cells in data tables

## Procedure

1. Check for layout tables: determine whether the content has a relationship with other content in both its column and its row. If “no," the table is a layout table. If “yes," the table is a data table.
2. For data tables, check that any cell that is associated with more than one row and/or one column header contains a headers attribute that lists the id for all headers associated with that cell.
3. For data tables where any cell contains an id or headers attribute,
  1. Check that each id listed in the headers attribute of the data cell matches the id attribute of a cell that is used as a header element
  2. Check that the headers attribute of a data cell contains the id attribute of all headers associated with the data cell
  3. Check that all ids are unique (that is, no two elements in the page have the same id)

## Expected Results

- If table is a layout table, no cells contain headers or id attributes
- If table is a data table and any cell contains an id attribute, checks #3.a, #3.b, and #3.c are true.
- If table is a data table and any cell is associated with more than one row and/or one column header, check #2 is true.

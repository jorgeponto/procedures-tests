# Tests for F3: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to using CSS to include images that convey important information

## Procedure

1. Examine all images added to the content via CSS, HTML style attributes, or dynamically in script as background images.
2. Check that the images do not convey important information.
3. If an image does convey important information, the information is provided to assistive technologies and is also available when the CSS image is not displayed.

## Expected Results

- If step #2 and step #3 are both false, then this failure condition applies and the content fails this Success Criterion.

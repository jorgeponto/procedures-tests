# SC 1.4.5 Images of Text - Level AA

If the technologies being used can achieve the visual presentation, text is used to convey information rather than images of text except for the following:

- **Customizable:** The image of text can be visually customized to the user's requirements;
- **Essential:** A particular presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed.

Note 1: Logotypes (text that is part of a logo or brand name) are considered essential.

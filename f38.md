# Tests for F38: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 due to not marking up decorative images in HTML in a way that allows assistive technology to ignore them

## Procedure

For any img element that is used for purely decorative content:

1. Check whether the element has no role attribute or has a role attribute value that is not presentation.
2. Check whether the element has no alt attribute or has an alt attribute with a value that is not null.

## Expected Results

- If step #1 is true and if step #2 is true, this failure condition applies and content fails the Success Criterion.

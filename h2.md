# Tests for H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource

## Procedure

- Check that every `img` element contained within the `a` element has a null value set for its alt attribute.
- Check that the `a` element contains an `img` element that has either a null alt attribute value or a value that supplements the link text and describes the image

## Expected Results

- All checks above are true.
